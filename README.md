## About The Project

In an era where collaboration is key, standard text editors feel isolated. Rico is designed to change that. Our mission is to build a "Google Docs-like" experience that is not only a joy to use but is also accessible for any developer to integrate into their own application.

This repository contains the entire Rico ecosystem, managed as a high-performance monorepo. It includes the standalone web app and the packages that power the embeddable component.
